# Molecular Orbitals with Jupyter Notebook

This notebook implements a practical session for a computational
chemistry laboratoy on Physical Chemistry (at undergrad level).
Psi4 is used for electronic structure calculations and NGLview
to visualize the orbitals. Interactivity in introduced by means
of ipywidgets.

The practical session involve electronic structure calculations
on diatomic molecules with DFT, and subsequent analysis of the
molecular orbitals and Potential Energy Curves for the scan along
the bond distance.

All input/output is in Spanish, although comments on code are in
English.

## Requirements

The notebook has been tested with python3.7. Older versions may not work.

The following packages are used, which can be installed through `conda`:

* nglview</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge nglview`

* ASE</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge ase`

* psi4</p>
`conda install -c psi4 psi4`

* ipywidgets</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets`

* matplotlib</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`

* ipympl</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge ipympl`

* numpy</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge numpy`

* scipy</p>
`conda install -c conda-forge scipy`

* QCElemental</p>
